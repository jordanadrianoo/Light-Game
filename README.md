# Arduino Light Game

This Arduino based project replicates an arcade machine that requires the user to stop the light at the right time. This project uses 12 LED diodes with a tactile switch. The Arduino uno will set a designated target LED for the users to attempt to hit. The game becomes faster and challenging to those who consistently hit the designated LED.
